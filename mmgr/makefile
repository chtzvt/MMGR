# Grok AutoBuild - A Useful Makefile
# (c) 2018 Charlton Trezevant - MIT License

# Overview:
# 	The stated goal of Grok is to introduce the basic concepts of automation
# 	by providing a thin, useful layer of abstraction over the more clerical parts of
# 	the software development workflow.
#
# 	While intended for use in an academic context,where a developer might be learning
# 	a language or related tooling, Grok may be adapted for any purpose seen fit
# 	by its user, and such experimentation or extension is in fact encouraged.
#
# 	This Makefile will automatically detect and build any C source file
# 	in the ./src/ directory whose name ends with '_main.c'. It additionally provides
# 	a useful set of aliases for various development tools and procedures.
#
#	Each rule in this file has its dependencies properly defined, and sanity checks are
#	performed where appropriate. Should a rule encounter an error, you will recieve a
# 	straightforward error message. You will not have to worry about losing work due to
#	any process performed by this file.
#
# 	This file has been meticulously commented, for your ease of understanding.

# Usage:
#	make all or make <your project name> - Compiles your project
#		Note: compiled executables will be placed in the directory ./bin/
#	make run - Compiles and executes your project
#	make test - Compiles your project and runs tests agains it (see below)
#	make testfile or make etf - Creates a test input file and opens it in your $EDITOR
#		Note: Nether of these will overwrite an existing test input file, they will only open it
#	in your editor or create one if it does not exist.
#	make lint - Static code analysis via scan-build
#		Note: this requres you to have scan-build installed on your system
#	make clean - Removes the ./bin/ directory
#	make help - prints a short (read: useless) help message, as well as the version of this file

# Notes on automated testing
# 	In its current form, Grok is capable of performing rudimentary testing of
# 	your compiled code. This is useful for debugging purposes, provided that you
# 	place the inputs required for reaching a success state in the file ./test_input.txt.
# How it works
# 	Given the files ./test_input.txt (and optionally ./test_args.txt), Grok will interactively
#   test your program by executing it and piping the input provided in ./test_input.txt to your program.
#   If you supply arguments in test_args.txt, the contents of that file will be passed in as arguments
#   when your program is executed.
# What this means
# 	Given the set of inputs that will (or should) produce a "successful" run of
# 	your program, Grok can easily run repeated tests against your code. Rather than
# 	spend time manually executing your program, running 'make test' will command Grok
# 	to automatically recompile, execute, and run through your program. As it does so, Grok
# 	will read from the test input file, printing each line of it in order as your program prompts
# 	the shell for input. Unlike a human, however, Grok will complete this process instantly.
# What isn't tested
# 	Although Travis CI (if in use with your repository) will perform more extensive testing (including
# 	static analysis/linting of your code), the test rule in this makefile will not perform any of those
# 	checks. Rather, this file will only test the behavior of your program at runtime.
# 	For static analysis, please install the scan-build package and run 'make lint'.
# 	For information about the scan-build package, visit https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html
# Creating the test_input file
# 	To create test_input.txt, simply fill the file with the inputs your program requires in the order
# 	in which your program expects or prompts for them. A working example is provided in this template.
# 	To easily create this file, use 'make testfile'
